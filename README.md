🧠 FaceSense – Real-Time Emotion Detector via Webcam (Portfolio Project)
FaceSense is a real-time emotion recognition system that uses a webcam to detect human facial expressions and classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. Built using Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace, this project showcases my skills in AI integration, live video processing, and computer vision. It’s the result of deep experimentation with TensorFlow/Keras versions, NumPy compatibility, and model optimization for smooth and accurate results.

🚀 Features
📸 Detects face in real time using OpenCV
😊 Classifies dominant emotion live using DeepFace
📦 Processes only face region (ROI) for better accuracy
🟨 Draws camera-style tracking box around your face
📈 Filters out low-confidence predictions
🔁 Frame skipping & prediction smoothing for better UX
🖼️ Supports flipped selfie-style camera view

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.10

Face Detection: OpenCV Haarcascade

Emotion Recognition: DeepFace (TensorFlow backend)

Image Processing: OpenCV

Backend AI: TensorFlow 2.10, Keras 2.10

Environment: Virtual Environment (venv) with fixed dependencies

Others: NumPy 1.23 for compatibility, real-time prediction loop

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
Deep integration of AI models with OpenCV

Real-time computer vision with face tracking

Optimizing DeepFace in live camera applications

Fixing dependency issues (TensorFlow, NumPy, Keras conflicts)

Face ROI handling for focused predictions

Handling asynchronous prediction without lag

⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is built purely for educational and portfolio purposes. It runs locally and does not store or share any facial data. Emotion detection results are based on publicly trained models and may not reflect deeper psychological states.

🧩 Future Enhancements
🟢 Add emoji overlays based on detected emotion
📊 Plot real-time emotion graphs over time
🧠 Option to switch between DeepFace and FER
🧾 Save emotion log with timestamps (CSV)
🖥️ Build a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
📤 Package as .exe for offline emotion analysis
