# 🧠 FaceSense – Real-Time Emotion Detector via Webcam (Portfolio Project)

**FaceSense** is a real-time emotion recognition system that uses a webcam to detect human facial expressions and classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.  
Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **DeepFace**, this project showcases my skills in AI model integration, live video processing, and computer vision.

It’s the result of deep experimentation with TensorFlow/Keras versions, NumPy compatibility, and model optimization to achieve smooth and accurate results in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Detects face in real time using OpenCV  
- 😊 Classifies dominant emotion live using DeepFace  
- 📦 Processes only the face region (ROI) for better accuracy  
- 🟨 Draws camera-style tracking box around your face  
- 📈 Filters out low-confidence predictions  
- 🔁 Skips redundant frames and smooths predictions  
- 🖼️ Supports flipped selfie-style camera view for natural interaction

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is built **purely for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes**.  
- It runs **locally only** and does not store or transmit any facial data.  
- Emotion detection is based on publicly available models and **may not represent deeper emotional states**.  
- Users are advised to treat predictions as indicative, not diagnostic.
